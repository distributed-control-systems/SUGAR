function r= normalize(self)


% NORMALIZE - Normalizes the multivector to unit length.
%
% Syntax:
%   r = normalize(self)
%
% Description:
%   This function normalizes the given multivector by dividing it by
%   its length, effectively scaling it to have a unit magnitude.
%
% Input:
%   self - (MV) The multivector to be normalized.
%
% Output:
%   r - (MV) The normalized multivector with unit length.
%
% Example:
%   mv = MV([1, 2, 3, 4], [2, 0]);
%   mv_normalized = normalize(mv);  % Normalizes the multivector mv
%   disp(mv_normalized);  % Displays the normalized multivector
%
% Note:
%   The function computes the length of the multivector and then scales
%   it by its reciprocal, resulting in a normalized multivector with
%   a length of 1.


    % Normalize the size of a multi-vector
    l=length(self);
    
        % Just divide by its length
        r=MV(self.vector/l,self.Lsignature,self.REPR);
