## Description of Main Examples

### **1. GA Mandelbrot**
These scripts implement Mandelbrot set visualization using **Geometric Algebra (GA)**. The provided MATLAB scripts allow exploring how GA can be used in complex plane computations.

### **2. Space-Time**
This section contains an implementation of **Lorentz transformations**, which are fundamental in **Special Relativity**. The script `Lorentz.m` simulates transformations between inertial reference frames.

### **3. Electrical Circuits**
This directory is currently empty but may contain future examples related to **circuit analysis using Geometric Algebra**.

### **4. Dual Numbers**
- `autodiff.m`: Demonstrates **automatic differentiation** using **dual numbers**, a technique useful in **kinematics, robotics, and optimization**.
- `readme.md`: Provides details on dual number computations.

### **5. Conformal Geometric Algebra (CGA)**
The **TEST_CGA** directory contains MATLAB implementations for **2D and 3D CGA operations**, including:
- Construction of **basic CGA objects** like points, lines, circles, and spheres.
- **Transformations** (rotation, translation, dilation, inversion) in CGA.
- **Intersections of geometric objects**.

### **6. 3D GA**
This directory is currently empty but may be used in the future for **3D Geometric Algebra applications**.

## Notes
- Some folders contain `.asv` files, which are **autosave backups** created by MATLAB.
- The **images** directory inside "GA Mandelbrot" contains visual outputs generated by the scripts.

This repository serves as an excellent reference for applying **Geometric Algebra** concepts to various domains such as **physics, automatic differentiation, and fractals**.
